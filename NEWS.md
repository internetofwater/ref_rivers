reference mainstems v1.0
========================

The initial release of the mainstems registry was created from v1 of:

> Blodgett, D.L., 2022, Mainstem Rivers of the Conterminous United States: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9BTKP3T. 

It identified 33853 mainstem identifiers with head and outlet identifiers bound to the NHDPlusV2.1 comid system. The network connecting headwaters to outlets is defined in: 

Blodgett, D.L., 2022, Updated CONUS river network attributes based on the E2NHDPlusV2 and NWMv2.1 networks: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9W79I7Q. 

*NOTE for next release:* a bug was found in the nework used for this initial release that will affect about 300 of the 33000 mainstems included in v1. Some v1 mainstems will be superseded as a result. Given that only NHDPlusV2.1 comids are used, the impact of this change will be minimal.
